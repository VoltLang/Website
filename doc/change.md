# Changes #

## Formalize naming convetion ##

Code uses non-standard function names for getting data from them. Might as
well reuse the Range names from D, like: popFront, front and so on. See
[Source] and [TokenStream].

## Remove Exceptions ##

Make it possible to use both the compier and Watt without Exceptions.

## Avoid pointers ##

In the quest to make as much code as possible @safe we should remove usage of
pointers in both [Volta] and [Watt].

## Adding get and set AA's ##

In light of the two above paragrahps. Lets take a look at AAs. Both [] array
index and in operator goes against these goals. Instead use a get function.

    bool get(T[Y])(Y key, ref T)

Like so. Set works just like the normal array index but is there to make a set.

    aa[key] = 4;
    aa.set(key, 4); // is the same
