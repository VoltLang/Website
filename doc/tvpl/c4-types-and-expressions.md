# Chapter 4 - Types and Expressions

In this chapter we'll cover most of the types, and the expressions that operate on them. Let's get started with the simple types; types that can exist on their own.

## Simple Types

### Integers

You've been introduced to one of the integers already; `i32`. The i stands for 'integer'. The number is how many bits - zeros and ones - represent the integer. That means the number determines the range of numbers that can be stored. For instance, the `i8` is 8 bits (1 byte) in size, and stores the integer range -128 to 127. If you add one to an `i8` holding a value of 127, it is said to 'overflow', and wraps around to -128. Here are all the signed integers:

	i8  min:-128 max:127
	i16 min:-32,768 max:32,767
	i32 min:âˆ’2,147,483,648 max:2,147,483,647
	i64 min:-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 max:9,223,372,036,854,775,807

As said, those are the 'signed' integers. The sign being the minus sign. There's another kind of integer - the 'unsigned' integer. As their name suggests, they don't hold negative values.

	u8  min:0 max:255
	u16 min:0 max:65,535
	u32 min:0 max:4,294,967,295
	u64 min:0 max:18,446,744,073,709,551,615

#### Integer Literals

A series of digits on their own is an integer literal:

	123
	46

If it's preceded by `-` it's a negative value:

	-4
	-42

Integer literals are signed by default, but if you put `U` on the end they will be given an unsigned type:

	32U
	56U

Underscores are ignored, this can help with larger numbers:

	1000_000_000
	3_2

A constant starting with `0x` is a [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) literal:

	0xFF  (same as 255)

A constant starting with `0b` is a [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) literal:

	0b10  (same as 2)

### Floating Point

Floating points represent numbers with a decimal place. You can't represent pi as an integer, so that's where the floating point types come in. Volt has two, like the integers they are delimited by size.

	f32
	f64

Floating points use the same expressions as integers so `5.0 / 2.0` gives the result `2.5`. Floating point is a big topic, and the finer details deserve their own document. If you're interested, [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) is a classic well worth reading.

#### Floating Point Literals

The simplest form of floating point literal is just a number with a decimal point in it:

	0.0

Floating point literals are double precision (`f64`) unless they end with `f`:

	0.0f

### Characters

Character types hold little pieces of text. There are three:

	char   1 byte wide, for UTF-8
	wchar  2 bytes wide, for UTF-16
	dchar  4 bytes wide, for UTF-32

#### Character Literals

A character in single quotes (`'`) is a character literal:

	'a'
	'2'

The 'escape' character is a backslash (`\`), this lets you insert various special characters that you can't type:

	\' The ' character
	\\ The \ character
	\0 An ASCII nul (a zero)
	\n A newline character
	\r Carriage return
	\t A tab

### Remaining Primitives

The last two primitives are `bool` and `void`.

`bool` is a [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) data type. It is either `true` or `false`.

`void` is not a type at all, but instead marks the absence of a type.

## Composite Types

These types can only be complete when paired with other composite types, and at least one concrete (a primitive, or user-defined) type.

### Arrays

We used these last chapter. To declare an array of type T, we would write `T[]`.

	i32[]     an array of i32s.
	bool[]    an array of bools.
	i16[][][] an array of an array of an array of i16s.

#### Array Literals

The `[` character denotes the start of the array literal. Values are separated by the `,` character, and the literal is ended with the `]` character:

	[1, 2, 3]
	['a', 'b']

### Pointers

A [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)) holds the address of another value. To declare a pointer to type T, we would write `T*`.

	i32*     a pointer to an i32.
	bool[]*  a pointer to an array of bools.
	char*[]  an array of pointers to chars.

### Associative Arrays

An [associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) associates 'keys' with 'values'. To declare a an associative array of T values, using J as a key, we would write `T[J]`.

	bool[i32]  an associative array of bools keyed by i32
		aa: bool[i32]
		aa[32] = false;
		writeln(aa[32])  // outputs 'false'
	void*[string]  an associative array of pointers to void keyed by string

#### Associative Array Literals

Like the array literals, associative array literals open with `[`, have values separated by `,`, and end with `]`. The values of an associative array literal have the key and value separated by a `:` character. So `[1:"hello", 2:"goodbye"]` would be a `string[i32]`, that has a key of "hello" associated with 1, and so on.

## Expressions

### Relational Operators

These return a `bool` value.

`==` is the equality operator. If the two sides of this expression are the same, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
