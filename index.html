      <h2>Performance.</h2>
      <p>Volt is a compiled language. There is no interpreting. This makes Volt fast - much like C and C++.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Expressiveness.</h2>
      <p>Volt has a very simple and straightforward syntax. This means you can make your own applications and utilities with very little work or effort.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Low-level control.</h2>
      <p>Volt has access to very low-level parts of your system which means you can do more with the underlying hardware.</p>
